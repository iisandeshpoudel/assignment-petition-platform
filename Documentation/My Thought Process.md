# Overview of the project with my thought process during the development phase
As I was interviewed for a Python Developer role, I decided to approach this assignment in a Pythonic manner. Consequently, I utilized the `venv` package to manage the virtual environment, and Django as the backend framework. For the front-end, I employed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Features with their details
Since this is a demo project, I decide to keep Sign up only with username and password intentionally for the sake of simplicity

# Deployment Overview
[Click here to visit the demo site](http://52.140.0.202:8000/)

For the deployment of this project, a Virtual Machine (VM) running Ubuntu was provisioned. The following steps were taken to ensure the successful deployment and accessibility of the application:

1.  **Inbound Port Configuration**: The inbound port on the VM was configured to allow external access to the application. While this exposes the application to the internet, it serves the purpose of showcasing the demo project.
2.  **Server Configuration**: The application server is running on port `0.0.0.0:5000`, which enables it to be accessible via the public IP address of the VM.
3.  **External Access**: To access the demo site, users can visit the following URL: [http://20.244.93.35:8000/](http://20.244.93.35:8000/)
Please note that while this deployment configuration allows for external access, it may introduce potential security risks. In an actual production environment, I will  implement additional security measures, such as firewalls, SSL/TLS encryption, and access control mechanisms, to ensure the protection of the application and its data.

### Key Files and Their Roles

-   **`settings.py`**: Contains all the settings and configurations for the Django project, such as database settings, installed apps, middleware, etc.
-   **`urls.py`**: The URL configuration file, routing URLs to appropriate views.
-   **`models.py`**: Defines the data models for the petitions, outlining the structure of the database tables.
-   **`views.py`**: Contains the logic for handling requests and returning responses.
-   **`templates/`**: HTML files that define the structure and layout of the web pages.

## Libraries or Tools Used

-   **Django**: The main framework used to build the application. It provides a robust structure for developing web applications.
-   **SQLite**: The default database used for development purposes. Django supports various databases, and SQLite is lightweight and easy to set up.
-   **Bootstrap**: Used for the front-end design to make the application responsive and visually appealing.

## Justifications for Design Decisions

1.  **Use of Django**:
    
    -   Django was chosen due to its high-level, scalable nature and built-in admin interface which speeds up development.
    -   The framework follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and has robust documentation and community support.
2.  **SQLite as Database**:
    
    -   SQLite is easy to set up and suitable for development and testing environments. It requires no additional configuration and is included with Python.



# Additional Steps or Configurations

### Creating a Superuser

To access the Django admin interface, you need to create a superuser:

```sh
python manage.py createsuperuser` 
```
Follow the prompts to set up your superuser account.

### Running Tests

To run tests and ensure everything is working correctly, use:

```sh
python manage.py test
```

### Static Files

During development, Django serves static files automatically. However, for production, you need to collect static files into a single directory:

```sh
python manage.py collectstatic
```
