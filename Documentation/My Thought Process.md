As I got interviewed as a Python Developer. I decided to do this assignment in a Pythonic way.
Hence, I used [venv](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#create-and-use-virtual-environments) package to manage the virtual environment and Django as the backend framework.
And HTML, CSS and JS for the front end.

### Features with their details
Since this is a demo project, I decide to keep Sign up only with username and password intentionally for the sake of simplicity

### Key Files and Their Roles

-   **`settings.py`**: Contains all the settings and configurations for the Django project, such as database settings, installed apps, middleware, etc.
-   **`urls.py`**: The URL configuration file, routing URLs to appropriate views.
-   **`models.py`**: Defines the data models for the petitions, outlining the structure of the database tables.
-   **`views.py`**: Contains the logic for handling requests and returning responses.
-   **`templates/`**: HTML files that define the structure and layout of the web pages.

## Libraries or Tools Used

-   **Django**: The main framework used to build the application. It provides a robust structure for developing web applications.
-   **SQLite**: The default database used for development purposes. Django supports various databases, and SQLite is lightweight and easy to set up.
-   **Bootstrap**: Used for the front-end design to make the application responsive and visually appealing.

## Justifications for Design Decisions

1.  **Use of Django**:
    
    -   Django was chosen due to its high-level, scalable nature and built-in admin interface which speeds up development.
    -   The framework follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and has robust documentation and community support.
2.  **SQLite as Database**:
    
    -   SQLite is easy to set up and suitable for development and testing environments. It requires no additional configuration and is included with Python.

3.  **Bootstrap for Frontend**:

    -   Bootstrap was used to create a responsive and modern user interface quickly. It offers pre-designed components and is highly customizable.

# Additional Steps or Configurations

### Creating a Superuser

To access the Django admin interface, you need to create a superuser:

```sh
python manage.py createsuperuser` 
```
Follow the prompts to set up your superuser account.

### Running Tests

To run tests and ensure everything is working correctly, use:

```sh
python manage.py test
```

### Static Files

During development, Django serves static files automatically. However, for production, you need to collect static files into a single directory:

```sh
python manage.py collectstatic
```
