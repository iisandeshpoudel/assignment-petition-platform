# Assignment Submission by Sandesh Poudel

I have created documentation for this assignment. I decided to divide this documentation two sections:
## [1. My Thought Process](https://github.com/iisandeshpoudel/assignment-petition-platform/blob/main/Documentation/My%20Thought%20Process.md)
In this section, I have provided my thought process for this assignment. It also includes the project setup, an overview of the code structure, the libraries and tools utilized, and justifications for the design decisions made.

## [2. How to run the Application Locally](https://github.com/iisandeshpoudel/assignment-petition-platform/blob/main/Documentation/How%20to%20run%20locally.md) 
In this section, I have provided a step-by-step guide on how to run this web application locally on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
